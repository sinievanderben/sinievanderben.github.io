# Minimal Academic Website

This is a minimal, single-page academic site you can deploy with **GitHub Pages**.

## How to use

1. Rename references in `index.html` (Your Name, links, bio).
2. Add your `headshot.jpg` (optional) and `cv.pdf` to the repo root.
3. Push to a public repo named `<your-username>.github.io`.
4. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Deploy from a branch** → `main` / root.
5. Your site will appear at: `https://<your-username>.github.io` within a minute.

## Customize
- Edit `style.css` for colors, layout, and fonts.
- Add more sections by copying the `<section>` blocks in `index.html`.
